# Welcome to the Namaste React Course Repository! By [Sanjit Gawade](https://github.com/SanjitSG)

Hello there! Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey through the Namaste React course by [_Akshay Saini_](https://github.com/akshaymarch7). 🌟

In this space, I'll be sharing my assignments, handwritten notes, and code snippets as I dive deeper into learning React. While the course itself is created by [_Akshay Saini & Namaste.Dev team_](https://namastedev.com/), this repository is my way of capturing and sharing my progress with the wider community.

### About My Journey

As a student eager to master React, I've embarked on this learning adventure to gain a deeper understanding of building dynamic and interactive web applications. Along the way, I'll be jotting down notes, tackling assignments, and experimenting with code.

### How to Navigate This Repository

- **Assignments**: Explore my solutions to the course assignments. Feel free to compare notes or offer feedback!
