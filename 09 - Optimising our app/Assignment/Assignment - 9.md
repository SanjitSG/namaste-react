**Q1: When and why do we need `lazy()`?**
Answer: `lazy()` is offered as a named import by React, it handles component loading.
- When our React app grows large with many components, loading everything at once might slow down initial page loading. `lazy()`
lets you load certain components until they are actually requested by the user.
- `lazy()` is used for **Code Spliting** is React. Code spliting breaks your application into smaller chunks. These chunks can be loaded on-demand based on which part of UI user is interacting with.
This makes the initial page load faster and provides a smoother user experience.

Q2: What is suspense?
Answer: Suspense is a wrapper component, it provides a mechanism for managing asynchronous operations during rendering process. Suspense allows ocmponents to temporarily pause rendering while asynchronous operation completes, like fetching the data from an API. This prevents parevents partially loaded content and errors.
You can provide a **Fallback UI** inside `<suspense>` , this fallback ui is displayed while async operation is ongoin. It can load loading indicators, Shimmer UI, or any placeholder you want to show user while they are waiting.

**Q3: Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?**
**Answer:** 
This Error occured because it took 100ms to from *Grocery.js* to load on the browser, but react is very fast, **The issue is that React tries to render the `Grocery` component before its code is even available.**

 Using suspense and startTransition we can handle this issue. React's Suspense mechanism helps manage asynchronous operations during rendering. It allows you to define a fallback UI (e.g., a loading indicator) that displays while a component is waiting for something (like data or a lazy-loaded component) to load.
 Here's an analogy:

-   Imagine a restaurant with two waiters:
    
    -   **`startTransition`  Waiter:**  This waiter prioritizes taking your order (the user interaction) first, even if the kitchen (the asynchronous operation) might take some time to prepare your food.
    -   **Fallback UI Waiter:**  While the first waiter takes your order, the second waiter might bring you some bread or water (the fallback UI) to hold you over until the main course is ready.

**In summary:**

-   `startTransition`  helps manage updates and prioritize user interactions.
-   Fallback UI provides a visual cue to the user while an asynchronous operation completes.
-   They work well together within Suspense boundaries to create a smooth user experience despite potential delays.

**Q4: Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?**
**Answer:**
## Advantages of Code Splitting

Code splitting offers several advantages for your React applications:

-   **Improved Initial Load Time:** By only loading the code necessary for the initial page render, code splitting helps reduce the overall bundle size of your application. This leads to faster initial page load times, especially on slower connections. Users see content quicker, resulting in a better initial user experience.
    
-   **Enhanced Performance:** Smaller bundles translate to less data for the browser to download and parse. This improves the overall performance of your application, leading to smoother navigation, faster interactions, and a more responsive user experience.
    
-   **Reduced Memory Usage:** Smaller bundles also mean less memory usage by the browser. This becomes especially important for users with limited device resources or for complex applications with a lot of code.
    
-   **Improved Scalability:** Code splitting allows you to manage your application codebase more effectively. You can easily add or remove features without affecting the entire bundle size. This makes your application more scalable and easier to maintain as it grows.
    
-   **Lazy Loading:** Code splitting enables lazy loading of components. This means components are loaded only when they are needed, further improving performance and user experience. Users don't have to wait for the entire application to load before they can interact with the initial content.
    

## Disadvantages of Code Splitting

While code splitting offers significant benefits, there are also some drawbacks to consider:

-   **Increased Complexity:** Implementing code splitting can add complexity to your codebase. You need to manage the loading and rendering of split code chunks, which might involve additional setup and configuration.
    
-   **Extra Network Requests:** Code splitting introduces additional network requests as the browser downloads separate code chunks. This can potentially impact performance on slower connections, especially if there are many split chunks.
    
-   **Potential for Regression:** If not managed properly, code splitting can lead to regression bugs. For example, a missing or incorrectly referenced split chunk could cause components to fail to render.
    
-   **Larger Overall Codebase:** While the initial bundle size is smaller, the overall codebase size might increase due to the additional logic needed for managing split chunks.
---
**Q5: 	When do we and why do we need suspense?**
**Asnwer:** We need Suspense in React applications to handle asynchronous operations gracefully and improve the user experience.
Suspense is a powerful mechanism in React that allows you to manage asynchronous operations effectively by providing a way to handle potential delays and display appropriate UI elements while waiting for data, components, or error handling.
